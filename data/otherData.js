Trusts can help bypass probate, distribute assets smoothly, and protect privacy. Updating your plan regularly, especially after major life changes, is key.

        content: "Car insurance premiums can be a major expense, but there are smart ways to lower your costs in 2025. Start by comparing quotes from multiple providers, loyalty doesn’t always equal savings. Bundle your home and auto policies for discounts. Maintain a clean driving record and consider taking a defensive driving course to qualify for lower rates.

Many insurers offer discounts for safety features like anti-lock brakes, anti-theft devices, and dash cams. Review your coverage annually, your needs may change. If your car is older, dropping comprehensive coverage might make sense. Improving your credit score can also lead to better rates. Lowering your premium isn’t just about finding the cheapest deal, it’s about getting the right coverage at the best value."
